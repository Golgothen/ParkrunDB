		<p>Good afternoon fellow parkrunners!</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p>Another action packed weekend with Victoria's second triple launch, giving us 86 events across the state and making the goal of statesman that extra bit elusive!</p>
		<p>Also having parkrun day fall on a leap year day makes for a special weekend, as this will only happen once every 28 years, making this the first leap year parkrun day in parkrun history! Only 1,461 parkruns until the next one (excluding special events)!</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p>As of writing, all results are in. There were no cancellations and Bright is yet to post volunteer stats.</p>
		<p><br></p>
		<p>Our three launches: 
		<ul>
			<li>Dandenong with 260, comes in 2nd largest launch for the year, and 15th largest overall in Victoria</li>
			<li>Peppertree with 232, comes in 3rd largest launch for the year, and 24th largest overall.</li>
			<li>Bendigo Botanic with 138, comes in as our smallest launch for the year, and 53rd largest overall.</li>
		</ul></p>
		<p>Combined, all three launches drew 630 runners, some 97 runners shy of Warringal's mammoth launch just two weeks prior.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>We had 11,643 runners (up 720 or 6.18%) with 2,350 PBs (20.18%), 1,546 tourists (including launches) visiting new events for the first time and 781 first timers, supported by 970 volunteers.</p>
		<p>The largest parkruns were Albert (588, down 65), Maribyrnong (443, up 59), Parkville (403, down 1), Studley (379, up 20) and Diamond Creek (374, up 10).</p>

			<li>Lillydale Lake with 359, just beating their previous record of 358, also set just 3 weeks ago.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The most PBs were at Warringal (96), Maribyrnong (90), Albert (88), Parkville (87) and Studley (75).</p>
		<p>The most PBs by proportion of field size was Kerang (37 or 45% or runners), KM Reedy (14, or 44%), Berwick Waters (20, or 35%), Warringal (96 or 33%) and Port Fairy (12, or 32%).</p>
		<p>The most first timers (excluding launches) appeared at Warringal (123), Albert (109), Parkville (77), Maribyrnong (61) and Gardiners Creek (58).</p>
